Today is the last day of August, 2014. Previously I preferrd summer because I thought I had more clear heads in summer, and I did not like to wear too much clothes.

As I learned some skills about java and eclipse this summer, I suddenly found that the agreements in [LeetCode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/)have lots of similarities with eclipse.

For example, I used to write the '{' in the next line,

``` c++
    for(String str : strs)
    {
        sort(str.begin(), str.end());
    }
```

instead of

``` c++
    for(String str : strs) {
        sort(str.begin(), str.end());
    }
```

In the latter way, Leetcode will automately generate a '{' for you when you entered a "enter".

What's more, "ctrl + D" is also the same in eclipse and LeetCode.

As far as I am concerned, I found Java could more easily construct a whole web system than c++. Furthmore, Java has more advantages in using Design Pattern.
